# LondonSocialClub Calendar

Tool to grab posts from the [/r/londonsocialclub](https://reddit.com/r/londonsocialclub) subreddit and organise them into a dedicated Google Calendar

*[Click this link to go directly to the calendar - read notes below first if on mobile](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/render?cid=YjN2M2w0M2dkazNmZzRoZGZzcWJhc2hpZWNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)* 

This will attempt to launch the Google Calendar website in desktop mode - if you are on mobile and are prompted to open the link in the app, click "No" or "Cancel" - the iOS/Android apps and the mobile website do not support adding a calendar to your account, it will just open your calendar app and nothing will happen.

Once you have added the calendar to your account, go into the app and make sure you have **Sync** enabled for this calendar in the app settings. This usually happens automatically but some people have reported it does not.
If Sync is not enabled, then the calendar won't be updated and you won't see any events.

If the above is not working for you, try using it from your laptop or PC and if you're still having problems after that, you can try using the AutoSubscriber app: [Auto Subscriber](https://github.aidyj.uk/LondonSocialClubCalendar/AutoSubscribe/)
