# LondonSocialClub Calendar

Tool to grab posts from the [/r/londonsocialclub](https://reddit.com/r/londonsocialclub) subreddit and organise them into a dedicated Google Calendar

*[Click this link to add the calendar to your Google account](https://github.aidyj.uk/LondonSocialClubCalendar/AutoSubscribe/)* (works on any device)

*[Click this link to go directly to the calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YjN2M2w0M2dkazNmZzRoZGZzcWJhc2hpZWNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)* (only works *easily* on a desktop browser, Google Calendar app and mobile site do not work)

Normally only the desktop browser version of Google Calendar allows you to manage your calendars, but you can use the first link to visit a page that will subscribe for you.

Once you have added the calendar to your account, make sure you have **Sync** enabled for this calendar in the app settings or you won't see any events.
